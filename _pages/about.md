I am a PhD student in [Hacking Lab](https://kaist-hacking.github.io/) at KAIST, advised by Prof. [Insu Yun](https://insuyun.github.io/). Previously, I was at [Networking and Mobile Systems Lab](https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr/), led by Prof. [Sung-Ju Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/). I am interested in designing and building practical solutions for real-world software security problems. Currently, I am working on automatic exploit generation for vulnerable smart contracts. Previously, I worked on projects that delve deeply into the Android OS, such as content moderation for the Youtube Android app and micro-virtualization to recover Android apps from compatibility crashes.
