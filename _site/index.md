## About

Hello! I am a Master's student in [Networking and Mobile Systems Lab](https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST. I am advised by Prof. [Sung-Ju Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/). My research interest spans across various topics in mobile systems and mobile computing. Currently, I am working on projects that delve deeply into the Android OS. 

I received my Bacheler's degree from KAIST in 2022, majoring in Computing Sciences and minoring in Intellectual Property.
