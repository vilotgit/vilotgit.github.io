## About

Hello! I am a MS-PhD Integrated student in [Hacking Lab](https://kaist-hacking.github.io/) at KAIST. I am advised by Prof. [Insu Yun](https://insuyun.github.io/). Previously, I was at [Networking and Mobile Systems Lab](https://nmsl.kaist.ac.kr/), led by Prof. [Sung-Ju Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/wewantsj/). 
My research interest spans across various topics in mobile systems and software security. I worked on projects that delve deeply into the Android OS. 
Currently, I am interested in designing and building practical solutions for real-world software security problems, such as designing a secure data sharing protocol for wearable devices and automatic exploit generation for vulnerable smart contracts.

I received my Bacheler's degree from KAIST in 2022, majoring in Computing Sciences and minoring in Intellectual Property.
